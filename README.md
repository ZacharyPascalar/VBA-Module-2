## Analyzing Stocks for 2017-2018
Steve asked for assistance for his parents to help analyze green stocks for 2017 and 2018, and I started an Excel file of the data he wanted analyzed.

## Green stocks analysis
###### 2017
In 2017, only TERP had a negative return. The rest were positive.
###### 2018
In 2018, only DQ and RUN had a positive return. The rest were negative.
## Code
It took 1.0625 seconds to run the code for 2017.

Refactoring code allows it to run faster when made to be more efficient since it will take the computer less time to process everything. The main disadvantage is the investment needed to go back and make it more efficient. For some projects (e.g. video games), more efficient code can make a very noticeable and important difference (i.e. better frame rate); for applications that aren't particularly time sensitive (e.g. Excel spreadsheets), it's probably not worth it as much if the person needs to wait a fraction of a second longer for something to calculate.
